# Single-Cell Resolution of fUNCtional HeterogeneitY (SCRUNCHY)

scrunchy provides a bioinformatic solution for analysis of single-cell
functional heterogeneity experiments.

1. A Snakemake pipeline for analysis of raw data.

1. An R package for analysis of processed sequencing data.

## Protocol

A detailed protocol for performing functional measurements of DNA repair
in the context of 10x Genomics single-cell mRNA sequencing kits is available at
[protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/single-cell-analysis-of-functional-heterogeneity-i-uhyet7w).

## Installation

Install the R analysis package:

```r 
devtools::install_github("hesselberthlab/scrunchy")
```

Install the Snakemake pipeline:

```python
nope
```
